RallyRestToolkitForVBA
======================

##What Is It?

A Rally REST toolkit written for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). VBA is a scripting language used by Microsoft Office (and other) applications.

##Why?
Why not? VBA is a useful toolkit for automating processes in Microsoft Excel, for one. The [Rally Excel Plugin](https://help.rallydev.com/rally-add-excel "Rally Excel Add-In"), while providing a nice UI-based interface for querying Rally, does not offer script-ability or automation.

##Why Not?
Excellent question. VBA may be quite slow and inefficient for accessing large amounts of data. It's not asynchronous, and can be a clumsy way to get data into/out of Rally in large volumes. But for small datasets, it could be convenient.

##How functional is this toolkit at this point in time?
Barely. Pre-alpha. Right now this is nothing more than a proof-of-concept for Querying Rally and Creating Rally Artifacts from VBA code. More to come though!
